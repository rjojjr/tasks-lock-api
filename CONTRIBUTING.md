## Branching Strategy

Try to create branch names labeled with the TODO identifier(ex: 'TODO-8').

### Commits

Each commit message should start with the branch name followed by a space(' '),
a hyphen('-'), another space and finally the message.

You should follow every commit message with a space, a hyphen, another
space and finally either your initials or Github username.
